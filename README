dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files and suckless-tools.

On Ubuntu, the command is ``sudo apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxinerama-dev sharutils suckless-tools``


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

In order to get the fonts working you will need to add these two
lines to your .xinitrc (replacing ${FONTDIR} with whatever font
directory you use):

    xset +fp ${FONTDIR}/.fonts
    xset fp rehash


Running dwm
-----------
In order to set dwm as a login session, cp the dwm.desktop file to ``/usr/share/xsessions/dwm.desktop``

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Usage
-----
Alt+Shift+Enter
    Launch xterm
Alt+Shift+C
	Kill a client (a window, if you must insist)
Alt+t
	Switch to tile layout
Alt+m
	Switch to monocle layout
Alt+f
	Switch to floating layout
Alt+b
	Show/hide bar
Alt+p
	Launch dmenu
Alt+[num]
	Switch to tag [num]
Alt+Shift+Ctrl+Q
	Quit dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
