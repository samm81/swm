swm - samuel window manager
============================
swm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X. Forked from dwm, the dynamic window manager.


Requirements
------------
In order to build swm you need the Xlib header files and suckless-tools.

On Ubuntu, the command is ``sudo apt-get install build-essential libx11-dev libxinerama-dev sharutils suckless-tools``


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (swm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install swm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

In order to get the fonts working you will need to add these two
lines to your .xinitrc (replacing ${FONTDIR} with whatever font
directory you use):

    xset +fp ${FONTDIR}/.fonts
    xset fp rehash


Running swm
-----------
In order to set swm as a login session, cp the swm.desktop file to ``/usr/share/xsessions/swm.desktop``

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec swm

	Add tag to current display
Win+Ctrl+[num]

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of swm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
